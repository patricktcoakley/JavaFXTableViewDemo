# Example JavaFX TableView Application

This example application connects to a sample database included with MySQL and produces a TableView using 
a join operation on an actor's first name, last name, the films they starred in, and their release date. The
 example application was created to learn more about working with JavaFX and databases, and is not representative of
  best practices. It was made within the constraints of the predefined database model and is simply meant to work as a 
   basic working prototype.

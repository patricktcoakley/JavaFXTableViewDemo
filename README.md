# Example JavaFX TableView Application

This example application connects to a sample database included with MySQL and produces a TableView using 
a join operation on an actor's first name, last name, the films they starred in, and their release date. The
 example application was created to learn more about working with databases in JavaFX prior to working on a bigger project.
